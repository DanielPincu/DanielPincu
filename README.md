# Hi, I’m Daniel Pincu 👋

I’m a software developer with a strong focus on modern web development and building complete, well-structured digital systems.  
My work centers on creating solutions that are reliable, scalable, and thoughtfully designed, with a strong emphasis on usability and long-term maintainability.

## About me
I enjoy working across the full development process, from early concepts and requirements to implementation and refinement.  
This includes building not only websites, but also full web applications, backend-driven systems, and CMS solutions tailored to real-world needs.

I am particularly interested in how frontend and backend technologies come together to form cohesive platforms that are efficient for developers and intuitive for users. Curiosity plays a central role in how I work, and I continuously explore new tools, frameworks, and workflows to improve performance, accessibility, and code quality.
